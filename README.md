# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to further our understanding of the extract, transform, load process in a big data environment. We accomplished this by gaining familiarity with tools such as AWS, PySpark and Google Collaboratory. In this exercise, we saved Amazon review datasets (Musical Instruments in my case) to our Amazon S3 bucket, extracted and transformed the data using PySpark, connected Postgres to our AWS server and loaded the results into Postgres.
